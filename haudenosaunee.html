									<p>
										The Haudenosaunee are a prominent group in Canada. 
										Also called the Iroquois, or the Six Nations group, they believed in the Great Spirit and having a spiritual balance with nature. 
										They believed in horticulture and were very matrilineal. 
										Some of their sacred festivals include the Midwinter Festival, the Green Corn Festival, and healing rituals.
									</p>

									<p>
										Longhouses played a significant role in Haudenosaunee culture, serving as homes and spiritual spaces for rituals, healing, and storytelling.
									</p>
									<!--
									<p>

										Spiritual leaders called faithkeepers were responsible for maintaining ceremonies and guiding the community's moral and spiritual life. 
										These traditions were not just religious, but also deeply political and social, as they reinforced the Confederacy’s values of unity, peace, and mutual respect.
									</p>
									-->

									<h2>Christian Influence and Cultural Disruption</h2>
									<p>
										Christian missionaries, specifically Jesuits, began arriving in Haudenosaunee territory to convert Indigenous people to Christianity. 
										When the French arrived, the Haudenosaunee were often at war, as the French were allied with many of their enemies. 
										The Iroquois wars were a series of conflicts that took place during the 17th century between the Haudenosaunee, other First Nation groups, and the French colonial forces.
									</p>

									<p>
										The conflicts and attempts at baptism led to divisions within the communities. many Haudenosaunee remained hostile, which led to the death of Jesuit missionaries, now known as Jesuit martyrs, and French missionaries being killed during conflicts. 
										In some cases, syncretism occurred, leading to some Haudenosaunee transforming their religion into the “Handsome Lake religion”, a combination of Indigenous ceremonies and Christian messages. 
										Yet, Christian forces still banned religious ceremonies and used residential schools to force the Haudenosaunee to assimilate into Christian culture.
									</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Resistance and Cultural Revival</h2>
									<p>
										Despite attempts to erase their religion, the Haudenosaunee preserved much of their cultural and spiritual identity. 
										The Handsome Lake Religion helped preserve their religion, maintaining many similar values, and still being practiced today.
									</p>

									<p>
										Yet during the 19th-20th century, the assimilative policies of Canada eroded the cultural history of the Haudenosaunee. 
										Many of their rights weren’t properly recognized, for example, the Jay Treaty of 1794, which stated that Indigenous people could freely cross the border for work or residence. 
										Some Mohawks protested when they failed to uphold this provision, eventually leading to Grand Chief Michael Mitchell crossing the border, stating he wouldn’t pay duties, which eventually led to the Supreme Court overturning his appeal, showing the injustices they face today.									</p>									
									<hr class="major" />

									<!--
									<h2>Legacy and Significance</h2>
									<p>Christianity deeply impacted the Haudenosaunee, but it did not destroy their religion. Many communities still grapple with the intergenerational trauma caused by forced conversion and residential schools. Yet, spiritual leaders and educators have continued to preserve teachings through oral history, ceremony, and cultural renewal.</p>									
									<p>Today, Haudenosaunee spiritual traditions remain a cornerstone of identity, guiding environmental stewardship, conflict resolution, and collective governance. Their story illustrates the complex effects of colonization — not just loss, but also survival, transformation, and the ongoing assertion of cultural sovereignty.</p>
									-->

									<h2>Significance</h2>
									<p>
										Understanding the Haudenosaunee’s experience with Christianity helps demonstrate how the Indigenous people of Canada resisted their cultural loss, and found ways to adapt be it through syncretism or the Handsome Lake religion. 
										Highlighting their resilience helps give appreciation, and demonstrate their ongoing fight for cultural survival and supports respect for the Haudenosaunee beliefs and traditions to this day.
